# h1b_explore

Playing around in a jupyter notebook using an H-1B dataset found here:<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa<br>

The goal was to practice data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, while learning a little bit about h-1b applications in the US.<br>

For some background, the H-1B is a visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in the US. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa. The H-1B has come under scrutiny over the past few years, and especially under the Trump administration (ex. http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/technology/business/h1b-visa-renewal-uscis/index.html).

Some interesting topics looked at in the analysis:
* how have Data Engineering H-1B applications changed over time
* Which companies are applying for the most Data Engineering H-1B applications
* Where are the most common company locations for Hardware Engineering H-1B applications
* Using H-1B prevailing wage as indicator for salary, how have Hardware Engineering applications changed by region
* What companies and in what locations are Data Science H-1B applications being filed
* What companies are filing for the most applications
