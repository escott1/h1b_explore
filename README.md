Playing around in a jupyter notebook using an H-1B dataset found here:<br>

The goal was to practice data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, while learning a little bit about h-1b applications in the US.<br>

For some background, the H-1B is a visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in the US. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa. The H-1B has come under scrutiny over the past few years, and especially under the Trump administration (ex. http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/technology/business/h1b-visa-renewal-uscis/index.html).
